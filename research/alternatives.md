## ‚úÖ **Alternative File Sharing Protocols to DC++**

In our **In-House P2P File Sharing System**, we're currently using **ADC Protocol (Advanced Direct Connect)** and **Tiger Tree Hashing (TTH)** for file sharing and indexing.

However, exploring **alternative P2P protocols like BitTorrent and IPFS** can **enhance performance, security, and scalability**.

## üìå **1Ô∏è‚É£ BitTorrent Protocol (Most Popular P2P Protocol)**
> **A distributed file-sharing protocol that uses a "Swarm Model" to download chunks of files from multiple peers simultaneously.**

### üî• **How It Works:**
- The **file is split into small pieces (chunks)**.
- A **torrent file (.torrent)** contains **metadata + file hash**.
- **Trackers** coordinate peers and **DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** enables peer discovery.
- Peers **download and upload chunks simultaneously (seeding and leeching).**
- Uses **SHA-1 hashing for chunk verification**.

### ‚úÖ **Key Features:**
| Feature                | BitTorrent |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Fully Decentralized   | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Chunk-Based File Transfer | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| High Speed with Parallel Download | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| File Integrity Check (SHA-1) | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Supports Magnet Links (No Tracker Needed) | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Peer Discovery via DHT | ‚úîÔ∏è |

### üìå **Best Use Case:**
- Large-scale file distribution (e.g., Linux ISO distribution).
- High-speed content delivery networks (CDN).

## üìå **2Ô∏è‚É£ IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)**
> A **Decentralized, Content-Addressed File Storage Network** based on **Merkle DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph)**.

### üî• **How It Works:**
- Each file or folder is **hashed and assigned a unique CID (Content Identifier)**.
- Files are split into **smaller immutable objects** and **stored across nodes in a distributed manner**.
- Data is **fetched via CID, not from a single server**.
- Uses **Kademlia DHT (Distributed Hash Table)** for peer discovery.

### ‚úÖ **Key Features:**
| Feature                | IPFS |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Fully Decentralized   | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Content-Based Addressing | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Immutable File System | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Peer Discovery via DHT | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Version Control & Pinning | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Supports Large File Handling | ‚úîÔ∏è |

### üìå **Best Use Case:**
- **Decentralized File Storage** (e.g., Web3 applications).
- **Immutable Data Sharing** (Blockchain apps).
- **Caching and CDN alternative.**

## üìå **3Ô∏è‚É£ WebRTC DataChannel (Real-Time P2P Communication Protocol)**
> **WebRTC is a browser-based protocol for direct P2P data transfer.**

### üî• **How It Works:**
- Establishes **direct P2P connection between two browsers** via **STUN/TURN servers for NAT traversal**.
- Supports **file sharing, video streaming, and real-time chat**.

### ‚úÖ **Key Features:**
| Feature                | WebRTC |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Peer-to-Peer in Browser | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Low Latency & Real-Time Communication | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| No Server Required (for data transfer) | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Secure (SRTP Encryption) | ‚úîÔ∏è |

### üìå **Best Use Case:**
- **Real-Time Collaboration Tools (like Google Meet, Zoom)**
- **P2P File Sharing without additional software**

## üìå **4Ô∏è‚É£ GNUnet (Privacy-Focused P2P Protocol)**
> **A fully decentralized, anonymous, and censorship-resistant P2P network.**

### ‚úÖ **Key Features:**
| Feature                | GNUnet |
|----------------|-------------------|
| Fully Anonymous | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Encrypted File Sharing | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Decentralized DHT | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Anti-Censorship | ‚úîÔ∏è |
| Tor Alternative | ‚úîÔ∏è |

### üìå **Best Use Case:**
- **Privacy-Centric Networks**
- **Anonymous File Sharing**

## üåü **Comparison of All Protocols:**
| Feature                | DC++ (ADC Protocol) | BitTorrent | IPFS | WebRTC | GNUnet |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Architecture | Hub-Based | Swarm Model | Content-Based | Direct P2P | Fully Decentralized |
| File Integrity | Tiger Tree Hashing | SHA-1 | Merkle DAG | N/A | SHA-256 |
| Peer Discovery | Central Hub | DHT Tracker | Kademlia DHT | STUN/TURN | Anonymous DHT |
| Security & Privacy | Moderate | Low | High | Medium | Very High |
| Speed | High | Very High | Moderate | High | Low |
| Best For | Small Network | Large Files | Decentralized Web | Real-Time File Sharing | Privacy-Centric File Sharing |

## ‚úÖ **Which Protocol Should We Use in Our In-House P2P Project?**
| Scenario               | Recommended Protocol |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| For Fast & Large File Transfers | **BitTorrent** |
| For Secure and Private File Sharing | **GNUnet or DC++ (ADC)** |
| For Decentralized, Immutable File Storage | **IPFS** |
| For Real-Time File Sharing in Campus | **WebRTC DataChannel** |
